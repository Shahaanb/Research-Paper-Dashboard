This paper explores the impact of AI on education. We highlight the main problem of scaling personalized learning.

INTRODUCTION
Artificial Intelligence has shown promise in adaptive tutoring systems. However, adoption is still limited.

METHODOLOGY
We conducted a mixed-methods study using surveys (N=300) and classroom experiments (n=25).

RESULTS
Our experiments show a 15% improvement in test scores when using AI-assisted tutoring.

DISCUSSION
While results are promising, some students reported reduced motivation due to automation.

CONCLUSION
AI can enhance education, but more longitudinal studies are needed.

FUTURE WORK
We propose exploring the role of AI in collaborative learning environments.
